      the use of codes and symbols.
    
   HTML is the standard for hypertext markup languages. the world wide web consortium,or w3c recommends it.
being such,most browser implement HTML to help display web pages more or less uniformly.

scientists coming from different collegs and universities accsess documents and research from other scientists.
that problem led to berners-lee inventing the world wide web, the hypertext transfer protocol or HTTP,and HTML.
